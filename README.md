# Flight Log

## Context:
FlightLog is a React Native app built by a team of 4 front-end developers. It lets pilots efficiently log flights, track essential details, and access comprehensive flight cards on the go. With its mobile-friendly interface, Flight Log makes flight management seamless, convenient, and accessible from anywhere.


## Technologies:
- **React Native**: We leveraged React Native, a popular JavaScript framework, to create a seamless and native-like mobile app experience across both Android and iOS platforms.

- **APIs**: Integrating external APIs allowed us to access and utilize valuable data and functionalities, enriching our app with real-time information and services.

- **Git**: We employed Git as our version control system, facilitating collaboration and enabling efficient tracking of code changes and improvements.

- **CircleCI**: CircleCI served as our robust CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) platform, automating the process of building, testing, and deploying our code. It played a crucial role in maintaining a reliable and efficient development workflow.

- **Figma**: Figma played a crucial role in our design process, serving as a collaborative platform for creating and visualizing the user interface and user experience (UI/UX) of our app.

## This Application Uses the FlightLog API

A RESTful API for logging, tracking, and managing flight records.

The goal was to deliver the best possible user experience with a seamless and engaging mobile application.
Full Stack Team Experience:

- Being part of a full-stack team, we contributed to all aspects of the project.
This experience provided us with a holistic understanding of the end-to-end development process.
Implement Agile Workflows:

- We embraced Agile methodologies to ensure an efficient and collaborative development process.
Daily stand-ups and retrospectives fostered effective communication and teamwork within our team.

## Wins:

- Successfully acquired proficiency in React Native and gained experience using the Xcode simulator to visualize the Document Object Model (DOM).
- Accomplished the successful deployment of the web version of our React Native app, expanding accessibility to a wider audience.
- Demonstrated strong problem-solving abilities and fostered effective collaboration within a full-stack team, resulting in a smooth project progress.

## Challenges:

- Overcoming challenges related to deploying the application using Vercel, ensuring a robust and reliable deployment process.
- Implemented Continuous Integration (CI) with CircleCI and Cypress, overcoming obstacles to ensure a seamless and efficient development workflow.

## Future Addition:

- Login: We recognize the importance of personalized experiences, and to achieve that, we would like to implement a secure and efficient login page.

- Real-Time Weather Updates: Never miss a weather update again! Our latest version will integrate real-time weather updates, providing you with crucial information about the day's conditions. 

## Installation Instructions:

### Download Xcode:

If you are using a Mac, go to the App Store and download Xcode, which is required for iOS development.
For Windows users, this step is not necessary if you intend to use Android emulation only.

### Install Node.js:

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download the latest version from the official Node.js website.

### Clone the Project Repository:

Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git or download the ZIP file and extract it.
Navigate to the Project Directory:

In the terminal or command prompt, change your working directory to the project folder.

### Install Dependencies:

Run the following command to install project dependencies:

```npm install```

### Start the Development Server:

To launch the development server, run the following command:

```npx expo start```

### View the App:

Once the development server starts, you will see a QR code in the terminal. Use the Expo Go app on your Android or iOS device to scan the QR code and view the app on your phone.

Alternatively, you can select one of the options presented in the terminal (such as "w" for web, "i" for iOS simulator, or "a" for Android emulator) to view the app in your preferred environment.
